        <h3> What is WiRE? </h3>
        <p>The world of distributed computational services is growing increasingly complex. What used to be a
          simple client/server system (in the early days of the Web) has radically transformed into billions of mobile
          clients, scalable cloud-based servers, and many layers of computational resources “in between” the two,
          positioned to improve the performance, reliability, and security of the entire endeavor.
        </p>
        <p>We believe an increasingly critical component in future edge infrastructures will be edge
          infrastructure that is located within a mobile transportation platform (e.g., a bus or car); this roaming edge
          will thus serve as the frontline computational resource for the increasingly sophisticated set of transport
          applications. Critically, the roaming edge can provide high bandwidth, low latency access to substantial
          computational and storage resources, thus enabling a new class of exciting applications to be realized.
        </p>
        <p>In the Wisconsin Roaming Edge (WiRE) project, we attack the central research challenges within
          the roaming edge, charting an aggressive path that seeks to solve critical research problems, create and
          disseminate related education offerings, and, through community building and open-source software,
          directly influence industry efforts in this important space.
