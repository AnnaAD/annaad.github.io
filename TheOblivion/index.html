<h2> The Oblivion </h2>
<p><b>Chapter 1</b><br />
We sat alone. The ground of the cave was mostly dry except for a few puddles. <br />
“Check mate.” You said, moving a black bishop diagonally across the chessboard in front of us. <br />
I looked half-heartedly down at the board, “You win... again. Do we have to keep playing this?” I sighed, hoping for one word only.<br />
 “I guess not, but what else is there to do in this godforsaken cave.” You exclaimed. I could hear the frustration begin to creep in the edges of your voice.<br />
 “I don’t know, magic?”<br />
 “Haha, very funny.” You replied curtly.<br />
 “You know we can. You just won’t admit that you were wrong!”<br />
 “Magic exists only in fairy tales, story books and children’s imaginations. Stop being ridiculous. It’s your fault we are stuck here in the first place!” You hissed angrily. I turned away from you and pulled my knees up to my chest, glaring at the rocks piled up surrounding us.<br />
 “Stop acting like a baby,” You said through clenched teeth as you began to pick up each polished chess piece and move it into the starting position.<br />
 “If you think I’m going to play with you again you’re delusional.”<br />
 “Fine, sulk in the corner alone, but chess helps me think.” I picked up my notebook and began to flip through the endless drawings and words of what you thought to be my imagination. <br />
 “Not that again,” you sighed tiredly, glancing at my carefully sketched diagrams.<br />
 “You know, if you just would believe me for one second we could get out of here.”<br />
 “Shh...” You say, your tone changed from hostile to urgent. A distant rumbling sound filled the cave, growing louder with each passing second. Suddenly voices echoed urgently throughout the cave, I could only make out a few words. <br />
 “Others?” You said confused, standing as if a higher vantage point would reveal the people we had so long been searching for.<br />
 “Of course, I see now...”<br />
 “What the heck, Cass? Even your stories of stupid magic don’t explain how someone else could get stuck here, in Oblivion.”<br />
 “Shh... those aren’t people, that’s The Vox! We have to get out of here!” I hissed under my breath scanning the walls, hoping to find an escape.<br />
 “Cass! Stop being stupid! We’ve been stuck in here for months! What makes you think one minute of looking around will find us an exit? I’ve checked everything. Don’t let your imagination get the best of you again! You would think you would have learned by now.” <br />
 “You’re the one who should have taken a hint! If there’s no way in or out, why do you think those voices sound so close?!” I whispered cruelly.<br />
 “The Oblivion works in mysterious ways.” You recite softly. Our dim light in the corner slowly flickered from yellow to red then went out.<br />
 “Maybe the Oblivion decided it’s time for us to do something.” I say definitely. “It kept us alive for something maybe ‘this’ is it.” Suddenly the walls of the cave melted away around us revealing an open field. <br />
 “Told you.” I said smiling mischievously.<br />
 “What the heck is going on?” You muttered half to yourself, gazing up at the star painted night sky, chessboard tucked under one arm. My thoughts abruptly were consumed by the thoughts of The Vox and my head spinned wildly, scanning the field. You looked towards me, your gaze stern, “Just because the Oblivion is real doesn’t mean that your collection of stories is. There is a logical explanation to whatever’s going on. We just have to find it.”<br />
 I looked over at you, an eyebrow raised up, “Yeah, because the Oblivion is so logical.”<br />
You sighed, not wanting to keep arguing. “So what are we going to do now?”<br />
“Well, we pick a direction, and walk.” I scanned the horizon for any sign of life, a building, a tree, anything. My searches went unsuccessful. <br />
You were looking at the sky until you abruptly turned back to me. “If the stars are anything like at home, then that way is north.”<br />
“And Home is the north-most city on the island, so we should go that way.” I exclaimed eagerly. You nodded in agreement and we walked silently in the direction I had pointed out.<br />
After hours, we still felt no need to stop because we neither hungry, thirsty, or tired. “Lorenn,” I said slowly, stopping in my tracks. You turned to me, waiting for me to continue my statement. “Something’s strange. The Oblivion hasn’t released us has it?” You took a deep breath and held it for a moment, as if you were testing how the air felt in your lungs. I continued, “We haven’t felt the need to stop, we could walk forever. If we are really in the real world, we would be hungry by now.”<br />
You turned back and met my gaze, “So what should we do then? We have no plan. We have no idea what we’re doing.”<br />
I looked out to the northern horizon, “We didn't have a plan in that cave, what's the point starting now?”<br />
You started to give an exasperated response but abruptly stopped. “What’s that?” You gasped, pointing to three distinct shadowy figures in the distance.<br />
“The Vox.”<br />
“What? Who- Nevermind anymore. I’m too tired to ask questions. Are we going to run or are we accepting our impending doom?”<br />
“There’s only one thing we can do.” I didn’t bother trying to explain myself as I frantically flipped through my notebooks pages. You raised your eyebrows, still skeptical even in the apparent danger of the moment. Finding what I was looking for, I read through the messy words and began to say them aloud. I held my breath, not sure what to expect, but expecting something big nonetheless. Yet, as the moments passed, nothing happened. <br />
“Just because this is the Oblivion doesn’t mean everything that Old Woman said that night was true.” This time your words are softer, gentler than the other times you have tried to sway me from my beliefs.<br />
“No. This has to work, why isn't it working?” I searched my mind, looking for answers. “It’s you...You don’t believe. You never have.”<br />
“Stop this right now. This isn’t the time to be pointing fingers, Cass. This is real.” You glanced back over your shoulder, the figures hadn't moved any closer but they swayed back and forth in a distinctly living sort of way.<br />
“No. I need to get away from you.” I started to back away, visions of magic and freedom pulling me farther and farther. I turned around, and began to run, my mind and vision blurred, I kept running, your shouts went unnoticed. Finally, after many moments, I paused and turned back, looking at you, small and frail against the vast sky, still clutching that chess board. I then turned back to my path, and only then did I realize, I had run straight to The Vox.<br />
Then, everything went dark.</p>

<p>
<b>Chapter 2</b><br />
The stars went out. I could still feel the grass beneath my feet and feel the same breeze, I was still in the field, only it was pitch black now. You slipped from my memory and I was alone. I couldn’t think about anything, I couldn’t think about what I should have been doing, all I could do was walk forward, hands outstretched reaching for where The Vox, the three figures sketched in my notebook, had been. A wave of stark cold whipped my face and hands and I could no longer move. I was stuck, frozen.<br />
Hello, Cass. Welcome.<br />
“Wh-Who are you?” I stammered, fear still clenching me tightly. No response came. You’re The Vox. I thought.<br />
No, my dear. I am something much larger. Larger than your mind could ever understand.<br />
“Let me go! I need to get back to- back to…”<br />
Hush, darling, don’t get yourself worked up. Why do you want me to let you go? In fact I have been holding you for months already... Haven’t you made yourself at home yet?<br />
“You're the Oblivion? Why did you let us..let me out of the cave?”<br />
Tsk. Tsk. Strike two. Wrong again. There is something much larger than the mortal scale going on here. Maybe, if you behave nicely, I’ll let you play a small role in it.<br />
“I don't want anything to do with you!”<br />
That’s not what I heard two months ago, when you came looking for us.<br />
“I- I didn't know.. I... Why do you want me here?”<br />
The voice emitted a sound resembling a chuckle. You really have a one track mind. Speaking of which, isn’t there something you’re forgetting?<br />
Suddenly, I could move again. The field came back, this time though, it was dawn, and a morning light seeped into the eastern sky. A figure appeared in the distance and fear returned. As the figure approached I realized it was a girl, whom I had never seen before, with dark brown curly hair that stopped abruptly at her chin. <br />
“Cass!” She shouted running up to me, “What happened-” She asked, gasping for breath.<br />
“Who- who are you?” I stuttered, confused.<br />
The girl’s face fell. “Oh no. Cass? You don’t recognize me?” The girl put her hand to her forehead and muttered angrily to herself through gritted teeth, “What childish, nightmarish trick is the Oblivion playing on me now?”<br />
“I’m sorry. I've never seen you in my life. How do you know my name?”<br />
“What? I know your name because I know you! Do you even remember how we got here? We came together. We knew eachother before too.” The girl looked extremely concerned, analyzing my face intently as if it would reveal to her what was wrong.<br />
“I got here because- because I was stupid.. But that has nothing to do with you.”<br />
“Well, you’re stupid, we can agree on that much. But I was there. This must be some sort of challenge, a trick, a puzzle. The Oblivion took your memory to test us or something.” The girl looked to me as if I would confirm or deny her theory. <br />
“I don’t remember you but I do believe that you could be right. The Oblivion is a place of mystery and magic, we need to explore, we need to find a way out. In the real world, things may work like you’d expect, logically. But here, there isn't one answer.”<br />
The girl stood thinking. “As much as this scares me, I think you may be right. When we followed the stars, navigation by logic and knowledge we made no progress. Yet when you, illogical as it was, ran off towards The Vox... It finally became dawn. Time passed, if only a little bit. I think we made progress.”<br />
“I think so too. And... uhh...What's your name again?” <br />
The girl’s eyes widened. But then she gave a small smile and stuck out her hand, “Lorren, nice to meet you?” She chuckled. <br />
I shook her hand playfully, “Nice to meet you too.”</p>

<p><b>Chapter 3</b></p>

<p>
I layed on my back in the grass, staring at the morning sky. Lorren set down her wooden box, decorated with a checkered black and white pattern. I decided not to question it considering all of the confusion here already. I stretched both my arms above my head, forming a diamond pattern with my fingers against the sky. <br />
“What if we flew out of here?” I asked.<br />
“Ha ha. Very funny.”<br />
“No, I’m serious. This isn't the real world, remember? Imagine this as a dream, if you realize what it is, you can control it.” <br />
“This is one messed up dream.” Lorren commented, sitting next to me. “So how do you propose we do it, Earhart?”<br />
“We don't have to know, we just have to believe.” I grinned, aware of the cliche. <br />
“God, you sound like a bad pamphlet for some inspirational seminar.”<br />
I rolled my eyes. <br />
