            <h3> Games </h3>
            <p>I have made a lot of games in the past in many different languages. I think games are pretty fun. Check out some of my earliest games <a href = "http://scratch.mit.edu/users/Ironbizmark">here</a> and some of my later works on under the products link where you can find free downloads to desktop games and mobile applications. So far all are free and have no ads, without a plan to add any. Enjoy!</p>

            <h3> Why annaad.com?</h3>
            <p><strong>Bootstrap and this Site</strong> What is the deal with AnnaAD.com? Well, I am planning for it to be a testing ground for some of my webdesign skills as well as a place for me to post cool projects, games, art, writing, blog posts, etc! So, one thing, there is my real name, or part of my real name, on this website. Weird right? I have tended to stay anonymous online for a long time but that has ended to some extent. Why? Because colleges might want something, or maybe an employer. This site could potentially function as a sort of cool portfolio for my work. <code>System.out.println("Oh Well...");</code> It proabaly took way to long and I should be writing an english essay right now...</p>

            <pre>
              <code>
//Java Code

System.out.println("Happy now?");

for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
System.out.println (i + " banana");
}
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p> This website is a testground for design and can be subject to major renovations and updates.</p>
