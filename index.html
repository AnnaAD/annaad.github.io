        <p> <strong> September-February 2021 - <a href = "http://vis.csail.mit.edu/covid-story/">Covid-Vis Project</a></strong> In tangent with the CovidVis team as a UROP student, created an interactive story in React about the narrative around Covid-based data visualizations and how they developped over social media.
