      <li><b>Island Flyover</b> - a Unity3D game where users take control of a low-poly plane and can explore. Inspired by my love of Wii Sports Resort island flyover mini game.</li>

      <h3> Fun Stuff </h3>
      <p>I am a big fan of corn mazes (a side-effect of being from Wisconsin), the ocean, and web development.
        I also enjoy reading and writing questionable quality novels. I've owned two nameless cats (yes it's a bit confusing).
        I tried a brief stint in stand-up comedy (ask me about it), but as you may have gathered I do not have the knack.
